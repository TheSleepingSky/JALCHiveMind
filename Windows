Windows Box

Forensics question- I went to the downloads on the profile it asked and looked into downloads and music files. Found it in the music files replaced the <type answer here> with music.

Removed unauthorized user drek- opened up the start menu. Went to admin tools and opened computer management. Went to users compared the users and didnâ€™t find him. I removed the user to gain points. 

User Qwark was not an admin- did the same thing as unauthorized users except I went to groups clicked admin and compared the list. 

Changed insecure password for user Orvus- I saw that his password was password. Entered admin tools to computer management. Right clicked on his name and updated password to a secure password. 

Firewall protection- turned on the firewall 

Removed rainbow crack password cracker- deleted it from programs.
